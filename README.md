# Vibe-Based Movie Selection



Dylan Bolter, Jacob Vossekuil, Ryan Maschler





This project is a movie recommendation and browsing system that allows users to find movies that they would enjoy. It takes the user's preferences for movies, searches for movies similar to those preferences, and shows them to the user. The user can then hide suggested movies if they have already been seen, or filter further by things such as genre, age rating, and more. After watching a movie, a user has the option to leave a review for other users to see.
